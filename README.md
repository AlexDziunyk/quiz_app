## What this app can do?
It is a quiz test with 5 steps, 3 questions each. There are three types of questions: multiple answers, open answers, and true/false.
The questions were created with the help of Contentful API. 
At the end of the quiz, you'll see a results page. Here, you can see the number of questions you answered correctly and recommended articles to improve.
I get those articles from Algoria. To search them I used default tags such as: react, css and so on because I filled index with info by myself I decided to use static query.
